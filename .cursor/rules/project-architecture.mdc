# Dynamic Agentic Systems - Project Architecture

## Dual Repository Structure
This project follows a dual repository structure:
- Frontend repository (separate)
- Backend repository (separate)

## Core System Components
The system consists of 8 specialized LangGraph nodes:
- Router Node: Intent classification and query routing
- Doc Node: PDF processing with Pinecone vector search
- DB Node: SQL/CSV data queries
- Math Node: Computational operations
- Persona Selector: LLM provider routing
- Suggestion Node: Follow-up query generation
- Answer Formatter: Metadata and screenshot integration
- UI: Three-panel interface

## Knowledge Base Strategy
- Document KB: PDFs chunked and indexed in Pinecone with metadata
- Database KB: Structured data (CSV/SQL) for financial time series
- Hybrid approach: Combines vector search with traditional database queries

## AI Personas
Three specialized agents:
- Financial Analyst: Math-heavy, stock analysis
- Legal Advisor: Compliance, contract analysis
- General Assistant: Mixed-domain queries

## Technical Stack
Backend: LangGraph, Pinecone, FastAPI, OCR
Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS/ShadCN, WebSocket
