# Frontend Development Guidelines

## UI Layout Requirements
- Three-panel responsive layout (Left/Center/Right)
- Left Panel: Knowledge base sources and persona management
- Center Panel: Chat interface, answer display, and suggested queries
- Right Panel: Metadata display and PDF page preview

## Component Structure
- Use TypeScript for all components
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Create reusable components for chat messages, file uploads, and panels
- Build mock API service layer that can be easily replaced with real endpoints

## State Management
- Use Zustand or Redux for complex state management
- Implement state machine for query processing flow
- Handle loading states and error recovery properly

## File Upload System
- Support PDFs and CSV files
- Implement client-side validation
- Create mock processing responses for development

## Mock Data Strategy
- Create comprehensive mock responses for each node
- Build mock PDFs with page numbers and screenshots
- Simulate different query flows (math, document, conversational)
- Use Mock Service Worker for API simulation

## Real-time Features
- Implement WebSocket simulation for query tracing
- Show visual progression through all 8 nodes
- Create real-time processing indicators
