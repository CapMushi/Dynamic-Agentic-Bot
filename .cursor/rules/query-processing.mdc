# Query Processing Guidelines

## Query Types
- Mathematical: Stock price trends, moving averages, thresholds
- Factual: Specific document-based questions
- Conversational: Multi-step, suggestion-driven dialogs

## Processing Flow
Query: "Tell me the Moving Average of MSFT from March to May 2024"
- Router → DBNode → MathNode → AnswerFormatter → UI
- Suggested Follow-up: "When did MSFT cross its 200-day MA in 2024?"

Query: "What clause handles data breach retention?"
- Router → DocNode → AnswerFormatter → UI
- Response includes page number and screenshot
- Suggested Follow-up: "Are there penalties for breach of NDA clauses?"

## Accuracy Requirements
- Vector DB (Pinecone) stores chunk content and metadata
- On match, response includes answer, exact page number, and screenshot
- Mathematical operations offloaded to dedicated Python nodes
- Document-based queries served from indexed vector stores

## Metadata Integration
- Include page numbers and screenshots in responses
- Store metadata (page number, image of chunk, title, section)
- Implement proper citation system
